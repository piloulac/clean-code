## Source code structure
> IN PROGRESS
1. Separate concepts vertically.
1. Related code should appear vertically dense.
1. Declare variables close to their usage.
1. Dependent functions should be close.
1. Similar functions should be close.
1. Place functions in the downward direction.
1. Keep lines short: with new screens, you should not have more than 120 characters per line.
1. Don't use horizontal alignment: you will break it at each auto formatting. Adding a character will break it. If adding 1 character breaks something, then, it means that it should not be done this way.
